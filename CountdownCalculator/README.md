Countdown Timer -  Python
This python implementation creates a countdown timer, that asks user for input and displays the time:minutes and seconds.

Algorithm

0. Start!
1. Import time module
2. Ask user to input length of countdown(sec)
3. User's value entered in (2) is used as a parameter in the user-defined function 'countdown()'. The input value is converted to a string.
4. While loop runs until time 't' becomes 0, inside the function.
5. divmod() calculates the number of minutes and seconds.
6. Print the minutes and seconds on screen.
7. end='/r' forces the cursor to go back to the start of screen.
8. time.sleep() make the code wait for a sec.
9. Decrement time so that while loop can converge.
10. End!
